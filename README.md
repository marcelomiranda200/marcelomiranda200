👩‍💻 Hi, I’m Marcelo 👨‍💻

👀 I'm 26 years old and currently studying Systems Analysis and Development, with a passion for technology, astronomy, the financial market, and foreign languages. I have a background in Hardware, Networking, and Systems, and I am dedicated to constantly improving my technical and personal skills to contribute to challenging projects and advance professionally. Currently, I'm focused on DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Backend development, especially using Java and Spring Boot. I’m proactive and quick to learn, looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and grow in a team environment.

🌱 I’m currently learning about Java, DevOps, Cloud technologies (especially AWS), and Spring Boot development.
